            Isolation and a lack of infrastructure compound the issues facing those living in remote 
            rural areas when it comes to accessing financial services. Agency Banking opens the door 
            to greater financial freedom by extending business hours to customers and offering greater 
            convenience to the rural population facing challenges due to poor infrastructure. Robust, 
            Sustainable, Agile The Lunn -Tech Agency Banking solution allows bank’s customers to access 
            basic banking transactions at a location convenient to them. The banking agent could be located
