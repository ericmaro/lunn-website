            The ESB gateway enables the interface of data between 2 or more systems in a 
            Service Oriented Architecture. Banks across the globe have swiftly embraced 
            electronic banking across multiple channels. As banks have adopted technology 
            for multi-channel banking, the limitation of technology to integrate with existing 
            systems of the bank to provide reliable information has been a challenge. Lunn-Tech 
            has developed the payBridge ESB gateway for system integration between the many 
            disparate systems running at the bank. The payBridge ESB gateway enables the interface 
            of data between 2 or more systems in a Service Oriented Architecture.
